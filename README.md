# AIM: 

To Assemble the Computer System

# PROCEDURE

1.Grounding oneself can be done by using an antistatic wrist-strap
cable to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD) which can be deadly 
to computer electronics. Alternatively, a large metal body like a
radiator can also be touched to discharge oneself.

2. To Open the case. Unscrew the side panel (or
slide it toward the back of the case) to do so.

3.Install the power supply. Some cases come with the power supply 
already installed, while others will require to purchase the power 
supply separately and install it ourself. Have to make sure that 
the power supply is installed in the correct orientation,and that
nothing is blocking the power supply's fan.
a. The power supply will usually go near the top or the
bottom rear of the case. Can determine where the power
supply is supposed to sit by looking for a missing section
on the back of the case.

4. Add components to the motherboard. This is
usually easiest to do before installing the
motherboard, as the case can limit ability towire 
components:

a. Attach the processor to the motherboard by finding the processor port on the
motherboard's surface. An indicator on CPU and motherboard will show the correct
orientation.
b. Attach RAM to the motherboard by finding the RAM slots and inserting the RAM
appropriately.
c. Attach power supply to the motherboard's power connectors.
d. Locate (but do not attach) the motherboard's hard drive SATA port. Can use this to
connect the hard drive to the motherboard later.

5. Apply thermal paste to the processor if necessary. Put a small dot (around the size of a grain of
rice or a pea) of thermal paste on the CPU. Adding too much thermal paste will create a mess,
such as getting paste into the motherboard socket, which may short circuit components and
decrease the motherboard's value if planning to sell it later.

6. Attach the heat sink. This varies from
heat sink to heat sink, so read the
instructions for the processor.
a. Most stock coolers attach
directly over the processor and
clip into the motherboard.
b. Aftermarket heat sinks may
have brackets that need to be
attached underneath the
motherboard.
c. Skip this step if processor has
an installed heat sink.

7. Prepare the case needs to knock the plates out 
of the back of the case in order to fit the
components into the correct positions.
a. If the case has separate shelving units
to hold the hard drive, install the units
using the included screws.
b. May need to install and wire the case's fans before installing any components. If so,
follow the case's fan installation instructions.

8. Secure the motherboard. Once the standoffs
are installed, place the motherboard in the
case and push it up against the backplate. All
of the back ports should fit into the holes in
the I/O backplate.
a. Use the screws provided to secure the
motherboard to the standoffs through
the shielded screw holes on the
motherboard.



9. Plug in the case connectors. These
tend to be located together on the
motherboard near the front of the
case. The order in which these are
connected will depend on which is
easiest. Make sure that the USB ports 
are connected, the Power and Reset 
switches, the LED power and hard
drive lights, and the audiocable.The
motherboardâ€™s documentation will
show where on the motherboard these
connectors attach.
a. There is typically only one
way that these connectors can
attach to the motherboard. Do not try to force anything to fit.

10. Install the hard drive. This process will vary slightly depending on your case, but should
typically go as follows:
a. Remove any front panels on the case.
b. Insert the hard drive into its slot (usually
near the top of the case).
c. Tighten any screws needed to hold the
drive-in place.
d. Plug the hard drive's SATA cable into the
SATA slot on the motherboard.



11. Connect the power supply to any necessary components. If the power supply is not connected
to components which need power, make sure that it is
connected to the following locations:
a. Motherboard
b. Graphics card(s)
c. Hard drive(s)

12. Finish the computer assembly. Once placed
and connected the various internal
components for the computer, all that's left to
do is ensure that none of the wires interfere 
with circulation and close up the case.
a. If bought a cooling system, install it
before proceeding. Refer to the
cooling system's installation
instructions in order to do so.
b. Many cases will have a panel which
either slides back into place or screws
onto the side of the case.
